# Prediction-KNN
KNN for desease prediction based

Example of how to develop and optimize a KNN model for classifying patients.

The script peforms a GridSearchCV to find the best K-Neighbors for a specific K-fold.

For validation purposes, a stratified cross validation strategy was followed.

Several scenarios with different variables considered are tested to know which combination of variables is better for prediction.
